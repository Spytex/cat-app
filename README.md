### Cat API Key Configuration

To access cat data within this project, you need an API key from [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com). Follow these steps to obtain the API key:

1. Visit [TheCatAPI website](https://thecatapi.com) and sign up for an account.
2. After signing in, navigate to your account dashboard or the API section to obtain your API key.
3. Once you have your API key, locate the `.env.local.example` file in the root directory of the project.
4. Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`.
5. Open the newly renamed `.env.local` file in a text editor.
6. Inside `.env.local`, find or add the line `NEXT_PUBLIC_CAT_API=<your-cat-api-key-here>` and replace `<your-cat-api-key-here>` with your actual API key obtained from TheCatAPI.

Remember to keep your API keys secure and never expose them publicly, especially in version control systems.
